# multi-agent-platform-evolution
This interdisciplinary, multi-agent modeling research platform studies the evolutionary laws of the platform economy, finding that "moderate innovation + limited imitation" maximizes system resilience. The research framework can be directly applied to the computational analysis of biomedical systems such as the tumor microenvironment.
